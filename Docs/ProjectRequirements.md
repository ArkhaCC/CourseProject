-Local Storage: Method for storing saved recipes for later use. Ultimately it would be easiest to store these as PDFs due to the format being easy to manipulate for features in the future. 
-Print Function: Application must be able to function as a 'virtual printer' and allow the user's PC to 'print' to the storage provided by the app. This will allow quick, no hassle collection of recipes for the viewer. Basic Windows file manipulation will come into play after the file has 'printed' to allow editing of file name/location (Print to PDF, store file for later viewing)
