## The Cookbook App


#Disclaimer: This application is very much a work in progress. This application has been my introduction to cradle to grave application design. I do intend to continue to tinker with this as time goes on, and I become more proficient.

This application is being designed to give the user a repository through which to store all of their favorite online recipes from a variety of sources, to give the user a way to bypass all those annoying advertisements and "story" sections that are so prevalent on typical cooking websites. The intention is to give the user a way to **save** **organize** and **access** their recipes without having to wade through the muck. The goal hear is to allow the user to focus on cooking.
